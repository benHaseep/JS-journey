API --> Application Programming Interface.

An **application programming interface** (**API**) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an _API specification_. A computer system that meets this standard is said to _implement_ or _expose_ an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.
